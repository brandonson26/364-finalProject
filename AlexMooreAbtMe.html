<!-- Documentation: I asked copilot to help my image show.
 I went step by step through this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU&t=1536s 
 I asked copilot to help me add rows and columns to my html file.                                            
 I used this youtube video to help me with the table and styling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK27jWKtJxs
 Copilot helped me with bolding texts and creating the class normal-text. 
 Copilot helped me link the CSS file and ensure it works with the html file

      Biographical Sketch
    </h2>
    <p class = "normal-text">
      My name is Alex Moore but I go by AJ. I have been playing tennis since I was three years old and now play for the Academy. My hobbies include playing video games, traveling, and learning about new things. I have a little brother who is currently 14 years old in 8th grade. He is aspiring to go to the Academy and become a pilot. We love to play rocket league together. One of my favorite places that I have traveled to is Japan. I mainly explored Tokyo but would like to visit Kyoto and Osaka the next time I go.
