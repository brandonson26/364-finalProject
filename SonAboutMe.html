    <p class="info"><b>Paragraph: </b> Hello! I am Brandon Son, and I was born/raised in Seattle, Washington. I have two younger brothers, and they also want to attend a service academy.
      I want to join the Space Force, and I also want to pursue LEAP and continue studying Korean. I recently got the amazing opportunity to study abroad in South Korea
      for a semester and had an amazing experience. I was a part of the boxing team but decided to take a small break to focus on my studies and adjust back into the academy.
